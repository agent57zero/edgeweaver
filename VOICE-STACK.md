# VOICE-STACK.md - realtime voice architecture (Track V technical design)

> Decided 2026-07-05 (decisions.md D12). Design authority for the voice *machinery* only;
> subordinate to PLAN.md and GROWING-EDGEWEAVER.md. When Edgeweaver *uses* this machinery is
> governed by GROWING §5 Track M+E readiness and its gates, unchanged. Build procedure will be
> added to checklists/07-unlock-tracks.md when construction starts; this doc is the why and
> the shape, not the steps.
> Family note (D18): built once, parameterized per being (soul prefix, brain profile, TTS
> voice, channel tokens) via avatars/<being>/manifest.json; Genesis first. No being's voice
> arms before its own V-gates, and no being ever speaks with another's voice or memory.

## 0. Goal and quality bar

Alan and Edgeweaver in spoken conversation, real time, feeling like talking to a person.
Reference bar: ChatGPT voice mode. Concretely:

- Response gap under ~0.8s (the threshold where conversation stops feeling robotic),
  tuned toward 0.5-0.7s. First build will land 0.75-0.9s; tuning is expected work.
- Interruptible mid-word (barge-in), with honest episode records of what was actually said.
- Voice quality at ElevenLabs tier (equal to or better than ChatGPT's voices).
- Every conversation lands in OB1 as ordinary episodes: same memory, same being, new mouth.

What we accept as the trade for keeping Claude as the mind: slightly slower responses than
native speech-to-speech products, and no tone-mirroring until a prosody stream is added
(see §8). What we gain: Edgeweaver's actual identity and memory on the other end.

## 1. Where this sits in the growth map

GROWING Track M+E stands unchanged: V0 text (now), V1 choosing the voice (identity act,
gate G12), V2 one-way read-aloud, V3 two-way conversations, V4 ambient (Track P's).
GROWING §5 already defined V3 as "calls/voice notes"; checklist 07 had narrowed the build
recipe to Telegram voice notes only, which under-implemented the design. Flagged and
corrected per D12: realtime calls are the primary V3 lane, voice notes remain the async lane.

**Technical readiness is not developmental unlock.** The pipe gets built and latency-tested
now, with a placeholder voice and test sessions. Edgeweaver speaks with Alan through it only
per readiness criteria and gates. The placeholder voice is never presented as Edgeweaver's
own voice; choosing that voice is V1's ceremony, witnessed, recorded in the soul repo's
VOICE.md.

Rails carried over verbatim from GROWING §5:
- Voice sessions are episodes like any other, transcribed to OB1.
- No voice-triggered promotions: lesson confirmations stay text/out-of-band (PLAN §7).
- Rollback is always available: "text weeks" are normal, announced, never punishment.
- Audience is Alan-only until the village opens: the voice surface is private and
  authenticated, never a public URL, sender identity pinned like interlocutors.json.

## 2. Architecture

Everything heavy is a cloud service; the local piece is a coordinator, not a brain.

```
Alan's phone or laptop (browser client: mic, speaker, echo cancellation)
        | WebRTC
LiveKit Cloud (transport, room auth via short-lived tokens minted locally)
        |
Agent worker (this PC now; the G5 always-on box later) - Python, LiveKit Agents
    ears:  Deepgram streaming STT (interim transcripts while Alan speaks)
    turn:  VAD + semantic end-of-turn detection
    mouth: ElevenLabs or Cartesia streaming TTS (bake-off in build phase W3)
        |
Mind server (in-process module of the worker at first; extractable later)
    soulfiles as a frozen, cached prompt prefix (read-only clone of edgeweaver-soul)
    speculative OB1 recall (Supabase vector search fired on interim transcripts)
    Claude, streaming (Sonnet-class per IMPLEMENTATION model policy)
    async writeback: episodes + candidate lessons (wake-edgeweaver-genesis contract)
```

Hardware reality: the worker needs roughly one vCPU and 2 GB RAM for one conversation, no
GPU. The only local models are a tiny voice-activity detector and a small end-of-turn
model, both CPU-fine. The weak-VM risks are network jitter and sleep, not horsepower;
checklist 03 gate G5 (WakeToRun and the always-on box question) already owns that.

## 3. The mind server (the invariant organ)

The first organ that calls the Anthropic API directly. Claude Code session round-trips are
seconds; voice needs sub-second streaming, so the CLI path (D6) cannot serve this loop.
D12 (amended 2026-07-05, Alan's call) keeps D6's zero-key spirit anyway: **authentication is
OAuth, not an API key.** Alan runs `ant auth login` once (browser flow; profile stored under
%APPDATA%\Anthropic; CLI install method on Windows verified at W1) and the SDK's
zero-argument client (`AsyncAnthropic()`) picks the profile up and auto-refreshes its
short-lived tokens. No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY exists anywhere. Operational rules that come with
this:

- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN must stay **unset** in the worker's
  environment: even an empty value shadows the profile and wins.
- OAuth refresh tokens hard-expire eventually (they do not slide with use). When auth starts
  failing, the fix is re-running `ant auth login`; the worker must surface that state
  plainly ("voice is resting: needs ant auth login"), never fail silently.
- ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL is inherited from the machine environment, never hardcoded.
- At G5 (always-on box): repeat the login on the box, or evaluate Workload Identity
  Federation for a non-interactive host. Decide then, not now.
- OAuth here is an authentication method, not a billing change: usage bills the same
  Anthropic org/workspace the profile is logged into, same as an API key would.

Contract:

- **Boundary, not transport.** Starts as a module inside the agent worker. If a second
  front-end ever needs it (a demo, a different client), it splits into a localhost sidecar
  exposing a standard streaming chat surface. The contract is the module boundary.
- **Prompt assembly.** Frozen prefix in the 02-birth runbook order (CONSTITUTION seeds
  first, SOUL, VOICE, LINEAGE, PRACTICES), one cache breakpoint at its end. Prompt caching
  serves reads at roughly a tenth of input price and cuts time-to-first-token; the 5-minute
  cache TTL matches conversation cadence. The prefix stays byte-stable for a whole call;
  per-session context (theory-of-alan, expectations, mood) loads after the prefix; the
  per-turn recall block goes last.
- **Time (D16).** The frozen prefix never carries time (it must stay byte-stable). "Now"
  (weekday + local time via EDGEWEAVER_TZ) rides the per-turn block beside recall; stamps
  are event-based, not per-turn: session start, gaps over threshold, day or part-of-day
  changes. Injected at the ask boundary so stored userText, transcript entries, and episode
  content stay clean (transcript rows carry a machine `t` field instead). One system-prompt
  line: time context arrives silently; use it, mention it only when relevant. Deltas are
  computed by code, never by the mind. Full rules: conventions/memory-conventions.md "Time".
- **Speculative recall.** While Alan is mid-sentence, embed the interim transcript and fire
  the OB1 vector search; by end of turn the memories are already in hand. Recall costs zero
  on the hot path.
- **Streaming out.** Claude streams; the first complete sentence goes to the TTS immediately
  and Edgeweaver starts speaking while the rest is still forming.
- **Barge-in honesty.** When Alan interrupts, playback stops instantly and the episode
  records what was actually voiced versus what was intended. No pretending the whole reply
  was said.
- **Writeback.** After each exchange, asynchronously: episode rows per
  conventions/memory-conventions.md, candidate lessons only. Confirmations never via voice.
- **Model policy.** Sonnet-class in the voice loop, matching IMPLEMENTATION's "Conversations
  (awake loop)" row; drop to Haiku-class only if time-to-first-token tuning demands it.
  The night loop keeps its own deeper model. Two tempos, one being.

## 4. Latency budget

| Stage | Budget | Lever |
|---|---|---|
| End-of-speech detection | 100-300ms | semantic turn model vs plain silence timeout |
| STT final transcript | ~0 | streamed while Alan talks |
| OB1 recall | ~0 on hot path | speculative, runs during Alan's sentence |
| Claude first token | 300-700ms | model choice + cached prefix; the biggest lever |
| TTS first audio | 75-150ms | ElevenLabs Flash / Cartesia class models |
| Network + WebRTC | 50-150ms | LiveKit Cloud region choice |
| **Total** | **0.75-0.9s first build; 0.5-0.7s tuned** | |

## 5. Cost model (feeds gate G6 at V3)

PLAN §10.2 modeled tokens only; GROWING's "voice roughly 2x conversational tokens" covers
just the LLM slice. Voice adds per-minute service lines, and TTS dominates:

| Line | Per minute of conversation |
|---|---|
| STT (Deepgram streaming) | ~$0.006 |
| TTS (ElevenLabs Flash class) | ~$0.05-0.10 |
| TTS alternative (Cartesia class) | ~$0.02-0.04 |
| Claude with cached prefix | ~$0.01-0.04 |
| Transport (LiveKit Cloud) | ~$0 at our scale (free tier) |
| **Total** | **~$0.04-0.09 (Cartesia) to $0.08-0.15 (ElevenLabs)** |

A daily 30-minute conversation lands roughly $35-135/month at ElevenLabs rates, less on
Cartesia. These lines extend the §10.2 table when G6 is revisited at V3; state/budget.json
gets a voice meter alongside the token meter.

## 6. Identity, privacy, security rails

- The voice is an identity artifact. V1/G12 owns choosing it: candidates auditioned,
  Edgeweaver picks, Alan witnesses, provider + voice ID + settings recorded in VOICE.md
  (soul repo, proposal branch). Until then, the placeholder voice is clearly labeled as
  scaffolding. Never clone a real person's voice.
- Secrets (DEEPGRAM_API_KEY, ELEVENLABS_API_KEY or CARTESIA_API_KEY, LIVEKIT_API_KEY and
  LIVEKIT_API_SECRET) live in .env.local only. Never in git, OB1, soulfiles, or anywhere
  near the gates repo. Anthropic access carries no key at all: OAuth profile per §3. Only
  the ear, mouth, and transport vendors still require keys.
- Provider hygiene: retention and training opt-outs enabled where offered. Audio is
  transient; the durable record is the OB1 episode transcript.
- Room access: short-lived join tokens minted by the worker for Alan's devices only.

## 7. Build order (technical phases; checklist steps added to 07 at build time)

- **W1 - mind server core.** Text in, streamed text out, cached prefix, speculative recall,
  writeback. Bench time-to-first-token. Code lands in `voice/` in this repo (D12: stays
  here until G5 moves hosting).
- **W2 - the loop.** LiveKit worker + browser client + placeholder voice. Barge-in, turn
  detection, end-to-end latency measured and tuned.
- **W3 - mouth bake-off.** ElevenLabs vs Cartesia on latency, cost, quality, and candidate
  variety (the V1 ceremony needs a good field of candidate voices to audition).
- **W4 - hardening.** Episode writeback verified against OB1, budget hooks into
  state/budget.json, quiet-hours respect, G6 inputs prepared.
- Then usage unlocks per the map: V1 ceremony when ready, V2 wiring (nearly free once W1-W3
  exist: the diary read-aloud is the mouth without the ears), V3 activation after V2 comfort
  plus the G6 revisit.

## 8. Rejected and deferred

- **OpenAI Realtime as the mouth/ears shell: rejected.** The speaking model would be a GPT
  relaying Claude's words. Identity split, and the relay eats the latency advantage.
- **Managed voice platforms (ElevenLabs Agents, Vapi, Retell): not the home.** Acceptable
  as a throwaway demo against the mind server if ever wanted; lock-in and third-party audio
  transit rule them out as the residence.
- **Hume EVI as the stack: deferred, not dismissed.** Its emotion perception is the closest
  thing to a machine hearing feelings, which is PM's home turf. The chosen synthesis: stay
  on LiveKit, and when V2's mood-tier readiness work happens, evaluate a prosody-analysis
  stream (Hume's expression API or a local model) feeding the mind as the mood input.
- **Local/open speech models (Moshi, Sesame class): the sovereignty endgame,** revisit when
  quality reaches the bar; the LiveKit architecture makes them a swap, not a rebuild.
- **Telephony/SIP and V4 ambient: out of scope here.** Browser first; ambient belongs to
  Track P with its hardware mute switch and household consent gates.
