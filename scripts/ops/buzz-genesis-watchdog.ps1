# Edgeweaver Genesis - Buzz channel watchdog (ASCII only)
#
# Relaunches Genesis's Buzz harness if it is down, stamps heartbeat and outage windows,
# mines dead letters before a relaunch, and notifies Alan on the ops line.
#
# Mirrors alpha-channel-watchdog.ps1, which is the mature copy of this pattern. Three
# things did NOT transfer from the Telegram version and are designed here rather than
# renamed: there is no poller pid file to key a DEAF check on (Buzz holds a WebSocket, so
# the socket IS the liveness signal), the dead-letter miner is Telegram-shaped and has to
# be adapted before it does anything here, and a terminal auth rejection must NOT be
# treated as a crash to retry.
#
# Built dark 2026-08-01 per buzz-harness-edgeweaver-plan.md B3. The scheduled task that
# calls this is registered by Alan at the B5 cutover, not by the loop.
